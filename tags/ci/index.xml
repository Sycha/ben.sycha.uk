<p>My &lsquo;GitHub Pages&rsquo; website keeps losing its custom url every time I push a new version! ðŸ™„</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I had originally used git hub actions to deploy my site based off of <a href="https://github.com/foosel/foosel.github.io">foosel&rsquo;s</a> work. Then I thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hey, I have a local gitlab instance that I just set up a CI runner on&hellip; so lets see if I can use that pipeline and have it push a fully build website to GitHub!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then found when the website was updating it was losing its CNAME setting in GitHub pages settings web ui. I thought I can keep an eye on that and fix it when needed.</p>
<p>Then I noticed a grammatical mistake and quickly updated it while I was settling the kids down and got distracted so forgot to check and fix it&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>
<p>Turns out that when you configure a customdomain in GitHub pages using <em>Deploy from a branch</em> it actually adds a CNAME file to the root of your repository with the domain name in it. Of course I hadn&rsquo;t included this file in my build pipeline so every deployment the web UI created CNAME file was ðŸ’¥<em><strong>OBLITERATED</strong></em>ðŸ’¥</p>
<h2 id="fix">Fix</h2>
<p>Simple, add create a CNAME file in the root of the built website to the build pipeline before I commit and push it to GitHub.</p>
