## Welcome!

Often when doing a project I learn something and want to share. So here we are.

Expect a mix of electronics, coding, 3d printing, home automation and some wheelchair rugby.

Maybe a bit of ADHD/ASD content as well since sharing adaptations can help others. Being Neurodivergent can be like having a specialised sports car for a brain that will excel on the right type of track. You might not know where that track is unless someone shows you.
