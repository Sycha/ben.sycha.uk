## Hi Hello!
I am Ben a tech enthusiast, optimistic project starter, wheelchair rugby coach and parent. I also happen to be neurodivergent [ND].

### What does my life look like?
In the week when the kids are at school I am a work from home DevOps/Software developer in a startup who uses his ADHD powers to learn platforms and techniques quickly, and then uses his ASD powers to organise and analyse code and deployments. I also inflict bad puns on co-workers.

Before and after work I am Dad{,dy} to my two ND kids, trying to find new way to assist them in finding adaptations to life to keep them regulated and happy. As well as usual parenting stuff, bad jokes, imagination games, listening to lots and lots of talk about minecraft.

On the weekend I am coach to the Berkshire Banshees wheelchair rugby team. I have been involved with the club since 2019, originally making up number if they were short of players and changing the odd tyre. Things snowballed from there, I became the head coach in 2021 and in 2022 I was awarded my Level 2 wheelchair rugby coaching certificate.

The club and team are a great group of people who support each other and put the work in. We came second in division 2 (end of 2022) having only just won division 1 the season before, which was our first competitive season! Very proud of the Banshees.

While I am not working, parenting or coaching I will usually be working on a technical/making project. I have a few 3d printers, design things in CAD, self-host some services, build electronics and automate the house using home assistant.
