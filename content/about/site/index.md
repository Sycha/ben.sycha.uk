### What will you find here?
Well I just started the site sooo a grow collection of techy project write ups, life thoughts and blog posts.

### Would you like to know more?
> The only good bug is a dead bug. <cite>Starship Troopers (1997)</cite>

Though actually I am environmentally conscious so don't actually kill all the bugs as they are important to our ecosystem and us all not dying. Except wasps, I hate wasps. Yes wasps are important too but it is really hard to admit that they are important as they make me really uncomfortable.

### Content Style
Will there be the occasional tangent? Yes, could I cut them out? probably. do I want to? not really at the moment. The aim is to communicate subjects I find interesting with my personality embedded in the content.


### Is this site perfect?
No, and that is something I am trying to work on accepting. Does it do the job yes. Can I make it better later yes. Would I ever push deploy if I waited until it was perfect? Most likely not.
