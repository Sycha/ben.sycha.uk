#### What does my life look like?
In the week when the kids are at school I am a work from home DevOps/Software developer in a startup who uses his ADHD powers to learn platforms and techniques quickly, and then uses his ASD powers to organise and analyse code and deployments. I also inflict bad puns on co-workers.

Before and after work I am Dad{,dy} to my two ND kids, trying to find new way to assist them in finding adaptations to life to keep them regulated and happy.
