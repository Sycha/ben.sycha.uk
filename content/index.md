## Hi Hello!

I am Ben a neurodivergent [ND] tech enthusiast, optimistic project starter, wheelchair rugby coach and parent.

### What will you find here?

Well I just started the site sooo a grow collection of techy project write ups, life thoughts and blog posts.

### Would you like to know more?

Though actually I am environmentally conscious so don't actually kill all the bugs as they are important to our ecosystem and us all not dying. Except wasps, I hate wasps.


Will there be the occasional tangent? Yes, could I cut them out? probably. do I want to? not really. The aim is to communicate subjects I find interesting with my personality embedded in the content.
