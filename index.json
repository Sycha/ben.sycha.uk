[{"content":"Problem I have never been a big fan of the using a piece of paper under the nozzle to tram different spots on the bed and I have always wanted to quickly just know the difference in height at each bed screw. I have a BLTouch installed so there has to be a better way.\nFirst solution I started off by using an OctoPrint macro plugin to move the head to screw positions and then use G30 to probe the distance. This was helpful but the feedback was spread over many response messages and I would have to work out the offset relevant to a particular screw. Doable but a bit to much hunting for values and maths in my head.\nBest solution so far Then I found G35 Tramming Assistant in the marlin firmware.\nI recompiled my firmware after updating these definitions:\n#define ASSISTED_TRAMMING #define TRAMMING_POINT_XY { { 31, 31 }, { 271, 31 }, { 271, 271 }, { 31, 271 } } #define REPORT_TRAMMING_MM Now when I run G35 all screw positions are probed and I get a simple readout like:\nTurn Front-Right CW by 0 turns and 3 minutes (-0.0300mm) Turn Back-Right CCW by 0 turns and 6 minutes (0.0525mm) Turn Back-Left CW by 0 turns and 6 minutes (-0.0550mm) Simple, easy to follow and saves me some brain cycles.\n","permalink":"https://ben.sycha.uk/til/how-to-quickly-tram-fdm-print-bed/","summary":"Problem I have never been a big fan of the using a piece of paper under the nozzle to tram different spots on the bed and I have always wanted to quickly just know the difference in height at each bed screw.

I am Ben a tech enthusiast, optimistic project starter, wheelchair rugby coach and parent. I also happen to be neurodivergent [ND].\nWhat does my life look like? In the week when the kids are at school I am a work from home DevOps/Software developer in a startup who uses his ADHD powers to learn platforms and techniques quickly, and then uses his ASD powers to organise and analyse code and deployments. I also inflict bad puns on co-workers.\nBefore and after work I am Dad{,dy} to my two ND kids, trying to find new way to assist them in finding adaptations to life to keep them regulated and happy. As well as usual parenting stuff, bad jokes, imagination games, listening to lots and lots of talk about minecraft.\nOn the weekend I am coach to the Berkshire Banshees wheelchair rugby team. I have been involved with the club since 2019, originally making up number if they were short of players and changing the odd tyre. Things snowballed from there, I became the head coach in 2021 and in 2022 I was awarded my Level 2 wheelchair rugby coaching certificate.\nThe club and team are a great group of people who support each other and put the work in. We came second in division 2 (end of 2022) having only just won division 1 the season before, which was our first competitive season! Very proud of the Banshees.\nWhile I am not working, parenting or coaching I will usually be working on a technical/making project. I have a few 3d printers, design things in CAD, self-host some services, build electronics and automate the house using home assistant.\n","permalink":"https://ben.sycha.uk/about/me/","summary":"Hi Hello!

No, and that is something I am trying to work on accepting. Does it do the job yes. Can I make it better later yes. Would I ever push deploy if I waited until it was perfect?
